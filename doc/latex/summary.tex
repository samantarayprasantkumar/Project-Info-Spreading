\begin{itemize}
\item Under certain circumstances the population profiles of the agent-based model differs significantly from those of the homogeneous model.
\item Individuals being more important for information spreading, in terms of cumulative infections, were found. The betweenness centrality might be used to roughly predict those especially influential individuals. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Future work on this topic, should focus on getting more advanced data. Such that, the problems mentioned in section 6.1 can be avoided. Obviously, it would also be of interest to preform the experiment with more individuals. e.g. several connected networks. Further analysis can be done in the dependence of the parameters e.g. $\lambda$ on characteristics of the network. Also the parameter $\alpha$ could be investigated in more detail. 
Further on, to compare or even confirm the results, it would be desirable to gather real world data.
