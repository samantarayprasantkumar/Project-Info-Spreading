A model for the information spreading in a social network was developed and investigated. The SIR model known from epidemiology was adapted to this problem. A homogeneous system, where the evolution is described by differential equations, was compared with an agent-based simulation. It was found that there are cases where they significantly differ. In the agent-based simulation, individuals that are way more important than the rest were identified. It was found that the betweenness centrality might be a key parameter to determine such influential individuals.
