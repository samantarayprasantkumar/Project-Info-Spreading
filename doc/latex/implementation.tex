\subsubsection{Initial condition}

At the beginning of each simulation, all agents are ignorant but one, which is a spreader. In the simulation, 

\subsubsection{Determine the meetings}

(See \texttt{talkstep.m} for details.)
\newline
\newline
In order to determine who meets who, the program goes through the vector of agents (1:N) randomly . With a probability corresponding to the activity of that agent, he may meet somebody . The person he meets is determined randomly and must be one he knows and one which is not already meeting another agent in this time step. Agents with more friends also have more meetings(If you don't take the activity into account). 

\subsection{Status changes in meetings}

After the meetings are determined, the status of each agent has to change according to the model. In order to be able to determine who infected whom, and how many where infected, a list \texttt{infecpath} was created in each round containing the directed edges of infections.
